Some months ago I wrote this Tetris in C64's Basic with the goal beeing to fit the listing in a single screen. 
After some maniac optimization work I achieved it, so the next goal was to make it a full tetris (that means, it needs to show the next piece in a corner). This was no easy, but painfully it worked. But it still was very slow, so then I optimized for speed, and lose some precious space and needed more damn optimizacion to get it. 

So, this is it, enjoy it. At some point I suffered a lot doing it, but I'm kinda proud of this little unusefull crap. 

You command it from keyboard (it used the joystick, but the peek to the CIA and the ANDs wasted a lot of space, and also there is no joystick buffer so some inputs were lost).  
A: to move to the left  
D: move to the rigth  
S: rotate
