Enhancements by Matthias Goebl at https://github.com/matgoebl/esp8266-ntsc-c64-emulator/
- PS/2 keyboard input with hotkeys
- Cursor display
- Wifi and OTA update
- Load builtin PRGs with hotkeys


## Limitations

This simple emulator is a proof-of-concept.
It only emulates the 6502 CPU of a C64 with basic video output for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PETSCII](PETSCII) characters.
It lacks emulation of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6582](SID chip) for sound output and
the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC](VIC chip) for sprites and graphics output.
It provides only 16KB of RAM (C64 has 64KB), it shows 14335 basic bytes free (C64: 38911 bytes free).
There is no joystick support, only keyboard input into the basic keyboard buffer,
so many assembly programs that access hardware keyboard registers wont work.
Therefore it is only usable for short commodore basic programs with PETSCII output and no PEEKs and POKEs.


## Demonstration programs

When looking for suitable demonstration programs, I found the [http://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/basic-10liners-2018](BASIC 10Liners contest):
It allows only short basic programs with no assembler and limited POKEs.
I found several programs with keyboard input and PETSCII output.
I added my selection into the [prg/](folder prg/).
The set is automatically built into the emulator and quickly loaded by pressing function keys (shift + F1..F12)
The license of the 10liners is unclear, the authors only agreed on publication of the source code
("The programmers agree to a publication of the programs, the descriptions and the instructions by the organizer").


## How to compile-in PRGs

- create e.g. hello-world.bas
- compile basic source into token: `petcat -w2 -o hello-world.prg hello-world.bas` (petcat comes with [http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/](VICE))
- convert binary into a C include file: `xxd -i hello-world.prg > hello-world.h`
- adapt hello-world.h: change `unsigned char` into `const PROGMEM unsigned char`

This is automatically performed by the script [prg/prg2h.sh], that creates [ESP8266-NTSC-C64/builtinprg_X.h].


## Keyboard layout

| Key         | Function       |
|-------------|----------------|
| Scroll-lock | ESP full reset |
| Shift-Esc   | C64 reset      |
| Esc         | Stop           |
| Tab         | Run            |
| Shift-F1 .. Shift-F12 | Load builtin PRG #1 .. #12 |


## Builtin PRGs

1. Hello World

What else :-)


2. 10 Print

A one-liner that prints a labyrinth. [https://10print.org/](more)



## OTA mode

Add your wifi ssid and psk to `wifi_credentials.h`.
Press escape within 1 second after ESP full reset (power-on or scroll-lock).
ESP will then enter wifi OTA mode.
Press scroll-lock again to boot to C64 mode.


## Used libraries

The following arduino esp8266 packages are needed:
- WiFiManager
- ArduinoOTA
- PS2Keyboard

PS2Keyboard requires a small fix: Add the following lines to `packages/esp8266/hardware/esp8266/2.4.2/variants/generic/common.h`:
    #ifndef CORE_INT_EVERY_PIN
    #define CORE_INT_EVERY_PIN
    #endif /* CORE_INT_EVERY_PIN */


## Hardware circuitry

### Video signal

This adaptor generates the CVBS video output signal from ESP RX pi.
When connected, flashing via serial doesn'n work - that's the reason OTA has been added.

### PS/2 keyboard

This simple level shifter limits the 5V output from PS/2 keyboard to 3.3V ESP inputs:

    PS/2 Data  -----<|----- ESP D3
                  1N4148

    PS/2 Clock -----<|----- ESP D2
                  1N4148
    (some keyboards might need an additional pullup to 5V at keyboard side)

### Audio output

Audio output is so far only used for beep output at startup, no SID emulation yet.

    GND -------#####---------||----- ESP D1
