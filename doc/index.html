  <h2>Story</h2>
  <p>Can you run a C64 emulation with 40x25 text composite video on
  a Wemos D1 Mini without additional components?</p>
  <p>The CPU emulator is a port of Mike Chambers 6502. And the
  composite video is based on the work of <a href=
  'https://github.com/cnlohr'>Cnlohr</a> and <a href=
  'https://github.com/hrvach/espple'>Hrvoje Cavrak</a></p><img src=

  <p>The video is output using DMA i2s and uses only about 10% of
  the CPU.The components makes a lowpass filter at 7MHz and a
  correct NTSC CVBS signal.</p>
  <p>The video has a resolution of 320x200 and is a subset of the
  upcoming ESP8266 TVout library.</p>
  <p>Here is the source code for the C64 emulator.</p>
  <p>These files are required for compiling it on the
  Arduino-IDE:</p><img src="c64files_4S64LG0R0i.jpg">
  <p>(A ZIP-file with the source code is attached for download)

  <p>The emulation has 16K free RAM for basic and only support for
  the 40x25 text mode.</p>
  <p>Keyboard code needs to be added and keys typed poked into the
  keyboard buffer.</p>
  <p>Otherwise it is fully functional.</p>
  <p>Have fun!</p>
  <p>11/12/2018 update:</p>
  <p>I'm in the process of porting my emulators to the ESP32.</p>
  <p>It has better native support for memory and video.</p>
